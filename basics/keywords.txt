break   -   breaks out of a loop or a switch block
case   -   marks a block of code in switch statements
char   -  single char data type
const  - defines a constant 
continue  -  continues to the nest iteration of a loop
default   -  specifies the deafult block of code in a switch statement
do  	  - used together with while to create a do/while loop
double	  - a data type that is usually 64 bits long which can store fractional numbers
else 	-	used in conditional statements
enum	-	deflares an enumerated type
float 	-	a data type thath is usually 32 bits long which can store fractional numbers
for 	- for loop
goto 	- jump to the line specified by a label
if	- make a conditional statement 
int	- a data type that is usually 32 bits long which can store whole numbers
long 	- ensures that an integer is at least 32 bits long ( use long long to ensure 64 bits )
return 	- return a value from a function
short	- reduces the size of an integer to 16 bits
signed	- specifies that an int or char can represent both positive and negative values 
sizeof 	- returns the amount of memory 
static 	- specifies that a variable in a function keeps its value after the function ends
struct 	- defines a structure
switch 	- selects one of many code blocks to be executed
typedef - defines a custom data type
unsigned - specifies that an int or char should only represent positive values
void 	- does not return a value or specifies a pointer to a data with an unspecified type
while 	- loop
